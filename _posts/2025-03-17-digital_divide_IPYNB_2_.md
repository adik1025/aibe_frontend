# What is Digital Divide?

 - The digital divide refers to the gap between individuals, communities, or countries with access to modern information and communication technology (ICT) and those without.
 - It includes disparities in internet access, availability of devices, and digital literacy.
Two main dimensions:
 - Access – Availability of internet and digital devices.
 - Usage – How people utilize technology effectively.


# Factors Contributing to the Digital Divide

### Demographic Disparities

 - Certain groups have unequal access to technology based on age, income, location, and education.

Examples
 - Economic Disparities – Lower-income individuals have less access to technology, limiting job opportunities.
 - Educational Disparities – Students without digital access struggle with online learning and digital coursework.
 - Geographical Disparities – Rural areas often have limited broadband infrastructure, affecting access to education, healthcare, and jobs.
 - Elderly Disparities – Older adults may struggle with digital literacy, leading to reduced participation in digital activities.

### Socioeconomic Disparities
 - Higher-income individuals and communities tend to have better access to digital tools and resources.
 - Innovation Gaps – Areas with limited digital infrastructure struggle with technological advancements.
 - Productivity Losses – Businesses with limited digital tools face lower efficiency and economic growth.
 - Digital Skills Gap – Individuals without access to digital learning struggle in modern workplaces.
 - Reduced Financial Access – Limited access to online banking and financial services affects economic participation.
 - Global Competitiveness – Countries lacking digital infrastructure fall behind in global markets.

### Geographic Disparities

 - Rural-Urban Divide – Urban areas have better digital infrastructure compared to rural and remote locations.
 - Infrastructure Limitations – Remote areas may lack broadband networks due to high costs.
 - Educational Barriers – Students in rural areas face challenges in accessing online learning tools.
 - Economic Impact – Urban centers attract businesses and innovation, while rural areas experience slower economic growth.
