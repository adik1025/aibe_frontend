    "## What is Binary Search?  \n",
    "Binary Search is a **divide-and-conquer** algorithm that efficiently finds a target value in a **sorted list** by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works (Step-by-Step)  \n",
    "1. **Ensure the list is sorted** before performing a binary search.  \n",
    "2. **Set pointers**:  \n",
    "   - `low = 0` â†’ Start of the list.  \n",
    "   - `high = len(arr) - 1` â†’ End of the list.  \n",
    "3. **Loop until `low > high`**:  \n",
    "   - Find the **middle index**:  \n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{mid} = \\frac{\\text{low} + \\text{high}}{2}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - Compare the middle element with the target:  \n",
    "     - If `arr[mid] == target` â†’ **Return the index** (found!).  \n",
    "     - If `arr[mid] < target` â†’ **Search right half** (update `low = mid + 1`).  \n",
    "     - If `arr[mid] > target` â†’ **Search left half** (update `high = mid - 1`).  \n",
    "4. If the target is not found, return `-1`.  \n",
