    "\n",
    "### Demographic Disparities\n",
    "\n",
    " - Certain groups have unequal access to technology based on age, income, location, and education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples\n",
    " - Economic Disparities – Lower-income individuals have less access to technology, limiting job opportunities.\n",
    " - Educational Disparities – Students without digital access struggle with online learning and digital coursework.\n",
    " - Geographical Disparities – Rural areas often have limited broadband infrastructure, affecting access to education, healthcare, and jobs.\n",
    " - Elderly Disparities – Older adults may struggle with digital literacy, leading to reduced participation in digital activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Socioeconomic Disparities\n",
    " - Higher-income individuals and communities tend to have better access to digital tools and resources.\n",
    " - Innovation Gaps – Areas with limited digital infrastructure struggle with technological advancements.\n",
    " - Productivity Losses – Businesses with limited digital tools face lower efficiency and economic growth.\n",
    " - Digital Skills Gap – Individuals without access to digital learning struggle in modern workplaces.\n",
    " - Reduced Financial Access – Limited access to online banking and financial services affects economic participation.\n",
    " - Global Competitiveness – Countries lacking digital infrastructure fall behind in global markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geographic Disparities\n",
