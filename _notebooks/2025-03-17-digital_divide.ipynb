    "# What is Digital Divide?\n",
    "\n",
    " - The digital divide refers to the gap between individuals, communities, or countries with access to modern information and communication technology (ICT) and those without.\n",
    " - It includes disparities in internet access, availability of devices, and digital literacy.\n",
    "Two main dimensions:\n",
    " - Access – Availability of internet and digital devices.\n",
    " - Usage – How people utilize technology effectively.\n"

    "### Economic Disparities\n",
    "\n",
    " - Cost of Technology: Many low-income individuals and families cannot afford computers, smartphones, or internet services.\n",
    " - Limited Access to Education & Job Opportunities: Without technology, individuals may struggle to develop digital skills needed for higher-paying jobs.\n",
    " - Schools in wealthier areas have better funding for technology, such as computers, smartboards, and coding programs.\n",
    " - Many low-income individuals lack access to online banking, digital payment platforms, and financial management tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Educational Disparities\n",
    " - Unequal Access to Technology in Schools: Schools in wealthier areas have better funding for technology, such as computers, smartboards, and coding programs.\n",
    " - Students in well-funded schools receive early exposure to coding, STEM programs, and digital tools, giving them a competitive edge.\n",
    " - Wealthier students could continue learning through virtual tutoring, online courses, and personal computers, widening the gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geographic Disparities\n",
    "\n",
    " - Rural-Urban Divide – Urban areas have better digital infrastructure compared to rural and remote locations.\n",
    " - Infrastructure Limitations – Remote areas may lack broadband networks due to high costs.\n",
    " - Educational Barriers – Students in rural areas face challenges in accessing online learning tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impacts of the Digital Divide\n",
    " - Affects access to education, jobs, healthcare, and economic opportunities.\n",
    " - Worsens existing social and economic inequalities.\n",
    " - Slows down technological innovation and global economic development.\n",
